        ACCESS TO DISCOUNTS <br><br>
        Opera Classica Europa is happy to offer discounts to all participants on the premise that during the application process, applicants will assist with spreading the word about what we're doing.
        <br><br>
        Once you send in your application, you will receive a code which your friends and contacts will be able to use as a 5% discount voucher (so that we know that we got their application because of your recommendation.)
        <br><br>

        For successful solo applicants:
        <br>
        If you get accepted to the program yourself as a soloist, for every 10 people that apply we’ll give you a 10% discount from your fees for the program.
        However if we pick someone from the applications we receive based on your recommendation to be a soloist as well… you’ll get a 30% discount!  The maximum discount you may receive is 50%,
        <br><br>

        For applicants that don't get a solo, but still wish to partake:
        <br> If someone you recommended us to gets picked for a solo place, but you didn't, this is what we can offer you:  Should that be the case, we’ll be happy to offer you a place in our chorus program, free of charge and with FREE accommodation in Espenschied.  All you’ll have to do is pick the opera and period you want to partake in and we’ll offer you the chorus.

        Once we receive your application, you’ll be sent a closing date for paying your fees and if by that date any of the above has occurred, you’ll be entitled to these discounts!
