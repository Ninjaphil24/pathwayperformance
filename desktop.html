          <h2>PURPOSE OF THE PATHWAY</h2>
          <p>Opera Classica Europa is proud to announce it’s newly expanded Summer Opera Studio:<br /> Opera Classica Europa’s Pathway to Performance.<br /><br /> In this, our 17th anniversary season, our OCE Emerging Artist program will collaborate with other Opera Organizations and Festivals including the opera festival "Cengio in Lirica" near Genova, the musical festival "Gegen Den Strom", Bad Homburg Music Summer, the Hellenic Opera Corporation and other festivals throughout Europe. Through our competitions and productions, we have provided young singers from around the world coveted stage experience. In addition, we have helped provide a pathway to professional engagement by providing important contacts. We have helped our past participants gain employment in Stuttgart, Oldenburg, Würzburg, Heidelberg, Pisa, Italy and in the National Theater Rumania in Constanta. Our instructional and professional staff are experienced performers, conductors, coaches and stage directors. Their vast experience will provide you with experientially based practical performance techniques. Opera Classica is singularly positioned to take you out of the practice room and onto the stage. We believe that one must apply their trade to grow as an artist. Please, visit our "CALENDAR" page to see our prices and to apply.</p>
